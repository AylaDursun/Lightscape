        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <button class="accordion">If I book the wrong date, can I transfer my ticket to another date?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Yes, but exchanges are subject to a $10 transaction fee per exchange. This fee applies to 
            members and nonmembers. Exchanges will not be allowed after November 1, 2022. Please contact
             the Customer Call Center at (847) 835-6801 to process. Tickets are subject to availability.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What happens if the weather turns bad after we buy tickets?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>We think a little snow adds to the beauty of the event, but, of course, if the weather presents a 
            hazard and a risk to safety, the Garden’s decision to cancel the event will be made at 2 p.m. on the 
            day of the event. You will be notified via email of any cancellation and the rebooking process.
            Also, please check our website and social media pages for updates. Rebookings will only be allowed if 
            the Garden cancels the event; otherwise, the event will take place rain or shine.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">How long is the trail?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>The trail is approximately a 1.25-mile path around the Garden’s main island.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Are the pathways wheelchair accessible?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>The route is designed so that it can be navigated on paved and crushed gravel paths. 
            The Chicago Botanic Garden has manual wheelchairs that can be loaned, free of charge, 
            on a first-come, first-served basis on the day of use; no advance reservations accepted. 
            The Garden’s ECVs (scooters) will not be available for rent during this event. If the 
            weather conditions prohibit the trail from being fully accessible, for those needing 
            mobility devices (wheelchairs, ECVs, walkers, etc.), consideration will be made on a 
            case-by-case basis to allow for tickets to be transferred to alternate dates. If you 
            have particular access requirements, please call the Garden at (847) 835-6801 for 
            further inquiries.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Is there white strobe lighting?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>There will be some lighting sequences that have some flashing lights contained within them; 
            however, there is no strobe lighting.</p>
